# Final-project
Final project for ReactJS course
I will create a website for small group people within a limited location
This website is called "Meal to eat"

## Meal to eat
###Purpose 
People go back to the office and they will share about the "best lunch special around" or "cheapest happy hour after work"
In order to keep this record and going to try, "Meal to eat" will allow people to search the restaurants and pin them into your map. 
These restaurants will be shown on the map and be generated into a to-do list.

###Functions
- Map of Melbourne City can be shown on the web page
- The search bar will allow auto-match results
- When the restaurant is picked, the restaurant location will be pinned into the Melbourne city map
- A to-do list label will be generated with info about the restaurant (Name, location,...)

###Advance Functions

-The error message will be poped 
-The to-do list label has "Liked" function to allow people to vote
